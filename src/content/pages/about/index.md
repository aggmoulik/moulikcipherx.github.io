We are Python users from Jaipur. We mostly include students and professional who loves to code in Python. We believe in endorsing Python and OSS/FOSS use and development of the same. As of now we organise monthly meetup. We respect all technologies . If you want to volunteer for PyJaipur you can join us in any of our social channels.
